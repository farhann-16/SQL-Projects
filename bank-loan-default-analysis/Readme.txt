# 💳 Bank Loan Default Prediction & Analysis

A **data analysis project** that studies loan applicant data to identify patterns in loan defaults, understand repayment behavior, and visualize trends.  
This project is built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Analyze historical loan data to find factors influencing loan defaults.
- Visualize trends in repayment behavior.
- Identify the impact of **credit score**, **income**, and **employment status** on loan repayment.
- Create an easy-to-understand **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** notebook.

## 📊 Analysis Tasks

1. **Default Rate Analysis** → % of loans that default.  
2. **Loan Amount Trends** → High vs. low-risk loan amounts.  
3. **Credit Score Impact** → Credit score vs. loan default likelihood.  
4. **Employment Status Effect** → Job type vs. repayment behavior.  
5. **Repayment Patterns** → On-time vs. delayed payments.

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- 📦 **Histogram** → Loan amount distribution.  
- 📊 **Bar Chart** → Default rate by employment type.  
- 🎯 **Scatter Plot** → Credit score vs. loan amount.  
- 📉 **Line Plot** → Monthly repayments trend.  
- 🔥 **Heatmap** → Correlation between income, credit score, and default.

## 📌 Key Insights

* Customers with **low credit scores** are more likely to default.
* **Self-employed** individuals have slightly higher default rates.
* Loan amounts above a certain threshold tend to carry more risk.
* On-time payments strongly correlate with higher credit scores.
