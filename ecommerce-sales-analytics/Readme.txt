# 🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard

A complete **data analysis project** that explores an e-commerce company’s sales dataset to uncover trends, top-performing products, customer insights, and delivery performance.  
This project uses **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main objective is to **analyze sales data** and extract business insights that can help improve decision-making.  
We aim to answer questions like:
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- What are the sales trends over time?
- How do customer demographics influence purchasing patterns?
- How efficient is the delivery process?
